//This is the only app-specific java file for the android project.  The real work is done in
//shared/android/v3_src/java.  When editing that, be careful, as it is used by all Proton projects.
//Thanks to Phil Hassey for his help and code


//the idea here is you can override values or functions in this project-specific file if needed without
// messing with the SharedActivity.java which is shared between projects.
// 
// You don't actually have to set anything here though.
